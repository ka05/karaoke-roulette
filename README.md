# Karaoke Roulette

## Context

Karaoke Roulette was a submission for RIT's Winter 2014 iOS App Challenge. The secret API for the event was Media Capture.

## Information

Given the secret API we wanted to make something fun and playful that incorporates multiple media inputs. In hindsight we might have been too ambitious in our plans as we initially wanted to make a Karaoke mash-up app, where you could mash-up your Karaoke with your friends.

Needless to say many of those features are slimmed down. However we had a ton of fun and learned a lot about Swift!

The features we are most proud of are our custom UI elements and transitions that we created, as well as the text scroll used to display the Karaoke lyrics. We had a lot of fun playing with these, and look forward to taking this experience with us.

Our target user would be everyday people who love Karaoke and like to have fun.
